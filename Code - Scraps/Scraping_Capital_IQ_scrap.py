Title: Scrapping Capital IQ 'public ownership' data.
Description: This code will be used each time you want to scrap public ownership data from Capital IQ. However, this code might be of help when constructing a
             different one that scraps different data, either from Capital IQ or any other source.
             This code is also parameter-based, so before everything you will have to set the parameters according to how you want to run the code.

PARAMETERS
    1. COMPUTER: Whether we will be using Edu or Luca's computer. This should be adapted for next users.
    2. OPEN_DRIVER: Whether to start the webdriver or not. If you run the code for a second time (after having already opened the webdriver once), then Selenium
       will open a second web driver. The problem with this is that if you have already logged into Capital IQ in the other webdriver, then after opening the
       second webdriver, the first one will be closed, so you would not be able to log out properly of Capital IQ from the first webdriver. Then, if you
       try to log into Capital IQ in the second driver, it will fail because Capital IQ will detect an outgoing session in another webdriver. This should be 
       avoided at all costs because Mireia Gine gets a notification when this happens. 
    3. LOGIN: Set to True if you want to log into Capital IQ, or set to False if the webdriver has already been opened and you have already logged in. 
    4. START: (int) First index to be iterated from the companies list.
    5. I_OPEN: (int) Number of iterations
    6. ALL_ROWS: Iterate through all companies from the list
    7. SECURITIES_TRACK: Leave always as True so it computes the dataframe with the id of each security (which is gotten from the HTML tags)

RECOMMENDATION: I would first run until line 62, so that I only open the webdriver. Then, I will go manually to the webdriver and change the download folder settings
so that all files downloaded from that webdriver go exactly to the selected folder that I want (data source in Capital IQ dropbox), that way we avoid unwanted 
files when constructing the dataset that would cause the code to crash. Once I have done this, I can re-run the code but setting 'open_driver = False' and 
'login=True'. If you haven't done any scrapping yet, then set 'start=0' and 'i_open' for as many iterations as you want. Then you can re-run it again for more
iterations (BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER WHERE DID THE SCRAPPING FINISHED THE LAST TIME!!). An easier option is to check that it works well by running a few iterations, 
and if it works well delete all the downloaded files (so we don't have duplicated files) and re-run it again setting 'all_rows = True'

    in the following path. So before starting again, it has to be imported again. I have called this dataframe All.securities_2.csv to avoid it
